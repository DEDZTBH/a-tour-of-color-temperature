    `Welcome to a tour of color temperature!
    Wait, what is color temperature? 
    Color temperature is the temperature at which a black body radiates light of this color.
    I know you are not here for a physics lesson. So lets get started.
    Please turn up screen brightness and fullscreen (top right) for the best experience.
    What you see now is the color temperature of candle light.`;
export const text2400 =
    `Now incandescent light we used back in the old days.
     You should feel comfortable and relaxed looking at low color temperatures 
     (aka. warmer colors), especially at night.`;
export const text2700 =
    `High Pressure Sodium streetlights.
    We used them mainly before LED streetlights.`;
export const text3000 =
    `Maximum color temperature for streetlights
    according to AMA's recommendation. Wait, but why?
    When we go to higher color temperatures, there is more blue light.
    And excessive blue light has many harmful effects at night.
    Especially to our health and to the Ecosystem. 
    You will see why soon.`;
export const text4100 =
    `Moonlight.
    This is how far nature goes in terms of color temperature at night.
    Species have been using the moon and the stars to navigate for billions of years.
    And then, artificial lights intrude into nature.`;
export const text5000 =
    `Sunlight. 
    You should not see sunlight at night.
    Neither should the Ecosystem.
    Yet, this is not where we stopped.`;
export const text6500 =
    `LED streetlights.
    I know you feel very uncomfortable right now. Lets continue!`;
export const text_decrease =
    `Excessive blue light at night makes us feel uncomfortable and stressed, as you just see.
     It disrupts our sleep cycle and leads to many long-term health problems.
     It causes glare that reduces our ability to see at night, imposing safety risks.
     It hinders animals' ability to navigate which can undermine their populations.
     It scatters in the atmosphere and causes Skyglow, blocking light from the stars.
     And the list goes on...
     To effectively reduce light pollution and minimize its damage, we should use non-excessive
     amount of lights that not only are properly shielded but also have warmer colors.
     Research shows around 2200K would be desirable for both our health and the Ecosystem.`
export const text1500 =
    `I hope you enjoyed this tour (except for the 6500K part)
    and thank you for being aware of light pollution.
    Use non-excessive, properly shielded, and warmer color light at night!
    Now, use this slider bar to choose your own color temperature!`;
