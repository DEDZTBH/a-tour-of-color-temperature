    `Welcome to a tour of color temperature!
    Wait, what is color temperature? 
    Color temperature is the temperature at which a blackbody radiates light of this color.
    I know you are not here for a physics lesson. So let's get started.
    Please turn up screen brightness and fullscreen (top right) for the best experience.
    What you see now is the color temperature of candle light.`;
export const text2200 =
    `High Pressure Sodium streetlights.
    These are the yellowish streetlights you might have seen.`;
export const text2700 =
    `Incandescent light bulbs we used back in the old days.
     You should feel comfortable and relaxed looking at low color temperatures 
     (aka warmer colors), especially at night.`;
export const text3000 =
    `Recommended maximum color temperature for lighting by American Medical Association (AMA)
    and International Dark Sky Association (IDA). Wait, but why?
    When we go to higher color temperatures, there is more blue light.
    And blue light has many harmful effects at night.
    Especially to our health and to the ecosystem. 
    You will see why soon.`;
export const text3400 =
    `Fluorescent Light. Notice that there is more and more blue light as color temperature increases.`;
export const text4100 =
    `Moonlight.
    This is how far nature goes in terms of color temperature at night.
    Some animal species have been using the Moon and the stars to navigate for billions of years.
    And then, artificial lights intruded into nature.`;
export const text5500 =
    `Sunlight. 
    You should not see sunlight at night. Neither should the ecosystem.
    But many LED lightings are trying to simulate sunlight at night.
    And yet, this is not where we stopped.`;
export const text6500 =
    `Cooler white LEDs are still in use for lighting. 
    And the white screen you are looking at right now.
    They spike in blue.
    I know you feel very uncomfortable right now. Lets go back!`;
export const text_decrease =
    `Blue light at night makes us feel uncomfortable and stressed, as you just see.
     It disrupts our sleep cycle and leads to many long-term health problems.
     It causes glare that could blind us temporarily, imposing safety risks.
     It hinders animals' ability to navigate, which can undermine their population numbers.
     It scatters in the atmosphere and causes skyglow, blocking light from the stars.
     And the list goes on...
     To effectively reduce light pollution and minimize its damage, we should use non-excessive
     amount of lights that not only are properly shielded but also have warmer colors.
     Thanks to evolving technologies, warmer color LEDs have become widely available. 
     They not only are ideal for our health and the ecosystem but also have higher Color Rendering Index 
     (aka enable us to see better at night).`
export const text1500 =
    `I hope you enjoyed this tour (except for the 6500K part)
    and thank you for being aware of light pollution.
    Use non-excessive, properly shielded, and warmer color light at night!
    Now, use this slider bar to choose your own color temperature!`;
